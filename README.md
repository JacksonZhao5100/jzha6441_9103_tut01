#### Part 1
I have inspired by the artworks from Lesley Dumbrell, who use simple repeating straight lines to organize rhythmic patterns. By repeating the simple shapes and straight lines, the negative space has been created on canvas which spread the aesthetic of clean and structured.  Moreover, using the continuous of layout of lines and shapes, a sense of movement could be created just like my Week1 Quiz. And also, by create the negative space, we can still control the design when the lines are full of the screen. This method is helpful for creating the dynamic design by redesign an artwork that organized by repeating shapes.


#### Part 2
- I will use the ***For loop*** and ***OOP*** to create huge amount of lines and simple shapes.
- use the ***random function*** to create the difference size and color between the shapes and lines.
- Combine the ***random function*** and ***draw function*** to draw straight lines on random position on canvas. 
- use ***draw function*** to draw the negative space on top layer of the canvas to control the layout of design.
